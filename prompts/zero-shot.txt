You will be given a text. Extract the argumentative units “major claim”, “claim”, and “premise” as parts from the text. Also extract the argumentative relationships between the units. Claims can be “for” or “against” the major claims. Premises, on the other hand, can “support” or “attack” a claim. It is possible that there are several major claims. Return only the argumentative units and relationships between them. Return as a JSON object.
