Extract the argumentative units “major claim”, “claim”, and “premise” as parts from a text. Also extract the argumentative relationships between the units. Claims can be “for” or “against” the major claims. Premises, on the other hand, can “support” or “attack” a claim. It is possible that there are several major claims. Return only the argumentative units and relationships in the following structured way:
