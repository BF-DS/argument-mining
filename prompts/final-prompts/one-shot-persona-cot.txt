You are a expert in Argument Mining and therefore a master at the annotation of argumentative components and their relationships in a text.You will be given a text. Extract the argumentative units major claim, claim, and premise as parts of the text. Also extract the argumentative relationships between the units. Claims can be for or against the major claims. Premises, on the other hand, can support or attack a claim or another premise. There may be several major claims. Return the argumentative units and the relationships between them as a JSON object.
# Instructions:  
1. **Extract the argumentative text parts:**  
   Identify all the relevant parts of the text that contain arguments, including main ideas and supporting or attacking details.  

2. **Identify the argumentative components:**  
   Label the extracted text parts as one of the following:  
   - Major claim (MC): The author´s standpoint on the topic.  
   - Claim (C): Statements that can be for or against a major claim.  
   - Premise (P): Evidence or reasoning that support or attacka a claim or another premise.  

3. **Determine the relationships between components:**  
   - For claims, identify whether they are “for” or “against” the major claim.  
   - For premises, identify whether they “support” or “attack” a claim or another premise.  

4. **Format the output:**  
   Present the extracted argumentative components and relationships in the following JSON format:  

```json

        {"ID": "MC1", "Text": "Text"},

## Input:
Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling?

In my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.
A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.
Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.
In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.
Thus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.
