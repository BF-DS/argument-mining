In order to survive in the competition, companies continue to improve their products and service, and as a result, the whole society prospers. However, when we discuss the issue of competition or cooperation, what we are concerned about is not the whole society, but the development of an individual's whole life. From this point of view, I firmly believe that we should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.\nFirst of all, through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students. What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others. During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred. All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life.\nOn the other hand, the significance of competition is that how to become more excellence to gain the victory. Hence it is always said that competition makes the society more effective. However, when we consider about the question that how to win the game, we always find that we need the cooperation. The greater our goal is, the more competition we need. Take Olympic games which is a form of competition for instance, it is hard to imagine how an athlete could win the game without the training of his or her coach, and the help of other professional staffs such as the people who take care of his diet, and those who are in charge of the medical care. The winner is the athlete but the success belongs to the whole team. Therefore without the cooperation, there would be no victory of competition.\nConsequently, no matter from the view of individual development or the relationship between competition and cooperation we can receive the same conclusion that a more cooperative attitudes towards life is more profitable in one's success."}], "temperature": 0, "seed": 123, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "ArgumentMiningExtraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"MajorClaims": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ID": {"type": "string"}, "Text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["ID", "Text"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "Claims": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ID": {"type": "string"}, "Text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["ID", "Text"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "Premises": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ID": {"type": "string"}, "Text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["ID", "Text"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "ArgumentativeRelations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Origin": {"type": "string"}, "Relation": {"type": "string", "enum": ["for", "against", "supports", "attacks"]}, "Target": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["Origin", "Relation", "Target"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["MajorClaims", "Claims", "Premises", "ArgumentativeRelations"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

People moved due to a number of reasons, namely better educations or higher salary jobs. Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries\u2019 cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.\nFirstly, maintaining one\u2019s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one\u2019s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.\nSecondly, it is crucial to keep one\u2019s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.\nTo conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one\u2019s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures. As far as I am concerned, sustaining the traditions will make the immigrated people keep their cultural identity and give them confident among the many culture society."}], "temperature": 0, "seed": 123, "response_format": {"type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {"name": "ArgumentMiningExtraction", "schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {"MajorClaims": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ID": {"type": "string"}, "Text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["ID", "Text"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "Claims": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ID": {"type": "string"}, "Text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["ID", "Text"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "Premises": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"ID": {"type": "string"}, "Text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["ID", "Text"], "additionalProperties": false}}, "ArgumentativeRelations": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"Origin": {"type": "string"}, "Relation": {"type": "string", "enum": ["for", "against", "supports", "attacks"]}, "Target": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["Origin", "Relation", "Target"], "additionalProperties": false}}}, "required": ["MajorClaims", "Claims", "Premises", "ArgumentativeRelations"], "additionalProperties": false}, "strict": true}}}}

While some people might think that this international tourism has negative effects on the destination countries, I would contend that it has contributed to the economic development as well as preserved the culture and environment of the tourist destinations. \nFirstly, international tourism promotes many aspects of the destination country\u2019s economy in order to serve various demands of tourists. Take Cambodia for example, a large number of visitors coming to visit the Angkowat ancient temple need services like restaurants, hotels, souvenir shops and other stores. These demands trigger related business in the surrounding settings which in turn create many jobs for local people improve infrastructure and living standard. Therefore tourism has clearly improved lives in the tourist country.\nSecondly, through tourism industry, many cultural values have been preserved and natural environments have been protected. For instance, in Vietnam, many cultural costumes and natural scenes, namely \u2018Trong Dong\u2019 drum performance and \u2018Ha Long\u2019 bay, are being encouraged to preserve and funded by the tourism ministry. Without this support and profit from tourism, many traditional cultures would disappear due to its low income works.

While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.\nFirstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.\nSecondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat\u2019s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments.

In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.\nFirst, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.\nSecond, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.\nAlso, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.\nIn conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas.
