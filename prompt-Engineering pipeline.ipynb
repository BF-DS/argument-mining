       "['## Input: Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling?\\n\\nIn my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\\nA student has to do lots of studies in today\\'s competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won\\'t be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\\nAnother reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\\nIn addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others.

Scientists and engineers have invented many novel products and tools, which play an important role in economic activity. Because of the technology of internet and air transportation, businessmen are able to handle plenty of international trade and financial transactions. This also helps many countries to more efficiently export their products to the world and increase their revenue.\\nBesides, advanced technology enables people to enhance their living-level and health care standard.

       " '## Input: Leisure activities - Spend your free time outdoors or indoors.\\n\\nPeople often relax themselves by joining leisure activities. Some people prefer to spend their free time indoors. But from my experience, I myself prefer to spend my leisure time outdoors because I strongly feel that it is good for health and keep my body fit. Also, outdoor activities enable me to socialize with other people and enjoy natural beauty.\\nThere are strong advantages to spend leisure time outdoors. One benefit is that doing outdoor activities such as soccer and baseball is good for one\\'s health. For instance, last year, I spent my summer time playing soccer and baseball. Playing baseball provided my upper body for hitting and throwing. Soccer, on the other hand, developed my lower body for kicking and endurance for playing full 90-minute-games. I belive that practicing these sports helped me greatly. Something else that is good is that playing these sports is to keep my body fit, make me ultimately refreshed. After that summer, my body is stronger and endurance is better. \\nOutdoor activities not only improves my health but also gives me chances to communicate with more people. When I was ten years old, I was a shy girl. My mother took me to The National Camp. At first, I just ate and played alone. But on the third day, while I was swimming, a friendly girl came and greeted me, we became friend later and she taught me how to swim effectively. On the next day, we played together and she introduced me to her friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as going skiing, climbing the mountain, I had a lot of friends since The National Camp. If, for example, I hadn\\'t participate in that camping, I wouldn\\'t have had many friends like today. \\nMoreover, you can also enjoy the beautiful nature when doing some outdoor activities like going hiking, sunbathing, going biking. If you spend your spare time at home or something like that, you can\\'t enjoy beautiful nature. Spending time outdoors, people can breathe fresh air, feel the warm sun on their face and enjoy the complete peace that only nature brings.\\nAdmittedly, indoor activities are fun. There\\'s no doubt that indoor activities like reading a book, watching TV or listening to music can bring us lots of joy. Although I can also have fun in indoor activities, this advantage cannot outweigh the attractions coming from outdoor activities. After all, people are people and we have our own propensity.

       " '## Input: Students should attend to classes or it should be optional?\\n\\nNowadays, it is often claimed that attending classes has a lot of benefits for students and provide them with a variety of learning opportunities (options) as well. On the contrary to this popular belief, there are still those who subscribe to this view that having a choice for attending classes enable students to study at home and through this way they do not waste their time for commuting and also they can save their money. However, I am inclined to believe that being present at classes seems a wiser option.\\nFirst and foremost, I truly believe that being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college. Also, they can help each other for learning materials better. However, if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems. \\nAnother significant fact which should be taken into consideration is that by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier since teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points. In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study. \\nFinally yet importantly, appearing in class makes students more conscientious since they have to obey class’s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments. However, the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times. Through this way, they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study. \\nOn the basis of the points mentioned above, I convinced that communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials. Moreover, teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it. Also, attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success. \\n## Output: {\\n  \"MajorClaims\": {\\n    \"MC1\": \"being present at classes seems a wiser option\",\\n    \"MC2\": \"communicating and studying with peer group is a good way for learning materials\"\\n  },\\n  \"Claims\": {\\n    \"C1\": \"being present at classes provide students with opportunity of communicating with other students that is beneficial for understanding new material by reviewing them throughout the free times in college\",\\n    \"C2\": \"by the help of teachers, students can understand ideas faster and easier\",\\n    \"C3\": \"appearing in class makes students more conscientious\",\\n    \"C4\": \"teachers have a conspicuous role in assisting students for learning materials that being present at classes is a requisite for benefiting it\",\\n    \"C5\": \"attending to classes makes students more attentive and have them to do their studies on time that this attitude lead them to success\"\\n  },\\n  \"Premises\": {\\n    \"P1\": \"they can help each other for learning materials better\",\\n    \"P2\": \"if they do not attend classes they cannot use the help of others for assisting them to comprehend difficult problems\",\\n    \"P3\": \"teachers explain them thoroughly in the class and after that give them a lot of examples to clarify the points\",\\n    \"P4\": \"In this way attending classes not only wastes their time but also facilitates their understanding process that takes them less time for comprehending materials in comparison with self-study\",\\n    \"P5\": \"they have to obey class\\\\u2019s disciplines and they practice to be more perseverance in the process of doing their assignments\",\\n    \"P6\": \"the ones who choose to study at home do not have any discipline for their studies and cannot force themselves to study in particular times\",\\n    \"P7\": \"they may miss some important parts in virtue of the chaotic and incoherent study\"\\n  },\\n  \"ArgumentativeRelations\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P2\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P1\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C1\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C2\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P3\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P4\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P6\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"P7\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C3\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P5\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P7\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C4\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C5\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}',\n",
       " '## Input: Should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject\\n\\nPresently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.\\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students\\' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.\\nThose who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected.

       " '## Input: Capital punishment; 51% countries have polished death penalty\\n\\n\"Capital punishment or the death penalty is a legal process whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime.\" In recently years, many countries have polished the law of the death penalty. In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.\\nFirstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims\\' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.\\nSecondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.\\nFinally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. \\nTo conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society. The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty. \\n## Output: {\\n  \"MajorClaims\": {\\n    \"MC1\": \"it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty\",\\n    \"MC2\": \"The world should consider clearly about polishing the law of the dead penalty\"\\n  },\\n  \"Claims\": {\\n    \"C1\": \"death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture\",\\n    \"C2\": \"nobody has the right to take another human life\",\\n    \"C3\": \"with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out\",\\n    \"C4\": \"it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society\"\\n  },\\n  \"Premises\": {\\n    \"P1\": \"Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one\",\\n    \"P2\": \"the criminal is repeated second time\",\\n    \"P3\": \"capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture\",\\n    \"P4\": \"the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being\",\\n    \"P5\": \"No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder\",\\n    \"P6\": \"If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal\",\\n    \"P7\": \"crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment\",\\n    \"P8\": \"if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral\",\\n    \"P9\": \"If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them\",\\n    \"P10\": \"They do not undergo any pain or misery\",\\n    \"P11\": \"Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds\",\\n    \"P12\": \"capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life\",\\n    \"P13\": \"rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts\",\\n    \"P14\": \"Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better\",\\n    \"P15\": \"some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors\",\\n    \"P16\": \"it is regarded as the \\\\\"legalized revenge\\\\\" to victims\\' family\"\\n  },\\n  \"ArgumentativeRelations\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C1\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C2\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C4\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"C3\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P2\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"P16\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P16\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P1\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P3\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P11\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P9\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P10\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P15\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P14\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P13\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P12\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C4\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P5\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"P4\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P4\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P6\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P8\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Origin\": \"P7\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}',\n",

Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students\\' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.\\nFirst, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations.

As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. \\nSecond, it would improve students\\' social behavior.

Any kinds of sports, such as jogging, swimming, or playing basketball, can effectively facilitate human respiration and circulation system. Moreover, these sports can also strengthen muscles and lessen surplus adipose tissues in human body. The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.\\nSports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one\\'s mind, creating positive feelings.

Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\n",
      "A student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\n",
      "Another reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\n",
      "In addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.\n",

    "# ## Input:\\nShould students be required to attend classes?\\n\\nThe issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\\nFirstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\\nSecondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\\nIn addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\\nFinally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\\nTo conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.\n",

       "\"Text: Prepared Food\\n\\nNowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.\\nFirst of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.\\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.\\nIn addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.\\nIn conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.\\n\""

The economic downturn has been exacerbated by the lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed by governments to slow the spread of the virus. The lockdowns have resulted in a significant decrease in economic activity, leading to a substantial increase in unemployment. The economic downturn has also had a negative impact on the environment, with increased greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. The lockdowns have been criticized for their effectiveness in slowing the spread of the virus, with some arguing that they have had a disproportionate impact on certain groups, such as the elderly and low-income households. The lockdowns have also been criticized for their negative impact on the economy, with some arguing that they have led to a significant increase in poverty and inequality. The lockdowns have been defended by some as being necessary to protect public health, with the argument that they have helped to slow the spread of the virus and reduce the number of cases.

This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\\nFirstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\\nSecondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\\nIn addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\\nFinally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\\nTo conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students.
