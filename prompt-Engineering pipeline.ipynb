      "The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\n",
      "Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\n",
      "Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\n",
      "In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\n",
      "Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\n",
      "To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.\n",

Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.\n",

They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous.

I firmly believe that psychopaths, terrorists or any other criminal who lacks empathy for other human lives deserve capital punishment.

      "Should students be required to attend classes?\n",
      "\n",
      "The issue at hand is whether it should be obligatory for university students to attend classes. This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\n",
      "Firstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\n",
      "Secondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\n",
      "In addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\n",
      "Finally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\n",
      "To conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.\n",

When a criminal becomes a threat to the society, such that they can commit heinous crimes, then they are given capital punishment. Thus, capital punishment protects the society from hardcore criminals.\n",

They can make mistakes which can sometimes affect an innocent, circumstantially marred criminals. The jury must therefore, take into account the circumstances of committing a crime. For example, if an individual murders someone for self-defense, then such a crime is not heinous. Only deserving criminals, who commit such hateful crimes in their proper senses are subjected to capital punishment.\n",

Every day comes with new challenges for them like walking, eating, etc., but those challenges of their initial life teach them important survival lessons which help them for whole life. For example, when they tried to learn walking, they stumble and hurt themselves many times. But they slowly tune their technique and learned to walk.\n",

      "Nowadays information plays an important role in our world. It has become a product, which can be sold, bought, or stolen. Some people say: \"information is power\". That's why it is so important to be well-informed. I consider the statement above to be right for several reasons.\n",
      "The first reason is that by using different sources of information we can guarantee its reliability. Some people may disinform you on purpose, that's why it is rather unwise to make conclusions before you are confident of the information. For example, Russian news announced that the war between Osetia and Georgia had been initiated by Georgia, however, european news announced that it was initiated by Russia. After a while the situation became clear, but before that a lot of people had already condemned the actions of Russia.\n",
      "Secondly, it is very important to know facts about some events or problem, not only estimations, because it can help you to make your own conclusion or estimate. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find out the facts, especially in the internet, that's why you have to look through different sources before you manage to find some reliable facts. It is possible to make a wrong decision because you have just used someone's personal opinion as a source of information, but it was actually wrong. For example, several years ago in Moscow salt became two times more expensive only in one week, because people thought that soon there would be no salt in the shops. The gossip-based information dramatically influenced the prices and only after official announcement the \"salt-panic\" was over. \n",

For example, in most asian countries, advertisement company usually hire popular singers or actors to advertise the products to boosts the sales, and some people, especially adolescent may buy things from their favourite singer advertised to support their idol instead of to fill their needs.\n",
      "In addition, products usually look more gorgeous and with good quality in advertisement, people are more likely to buy goods impulsively without a second thought. A good advertisement can convince people to believe that it is what they want, even though it is not the real needs of the society. And there are always people purchase particular products swayed by advertising which makes it a trend to follow for other people who is unnecessarily need it.\n",
      "However, buying habit is a very personal things for individuals, the advertisement is not the only cause for people to buy, sometimes it depends on one's needs and ability of consumption. It is unlikely to buy things impulsively for adults who have concern of arranging disposable income. Most of them have to allocate the money if they doing other purchase. On the other hand, children and adolescents who is not economic independence is more possible to buy things impulsively without considering whether they need it or not, since they do not have financial pressure from life and ability to define what is necessary.\n",
      "In my opinion, I think buying habit is people's choice to make, not entirely affected by advertisements. But for children or adolescents who is not mentally develop, it might be hard for them not to swayed by advertising.

Not only that, when they are in a university, they will have the opportunity to share their knowledge as well as to network for business associates and partners. This can benefit them in future when they intend to open up their own companies or hospitals.\n",
      "Looking from another perspective, there are also a significant number of people who are very successful in their fields without going to university. Take for instance those who start their own business. These people depend solely on hard work and luck. Interestingly, for some of them it proved to be a profitable job. To cite an example, Michael Dell who is the founder and the CEO of Dell left college at 19. Initially, he started his computer company in his college dorm room. Eventually, he used his earnings as well as his family's loan in order to progress to be who he is now.\n",
      "In addition, people with natural talents are also most likely to excel in their life. This is especially true in sectors like entertainment and sports. The introduction of increasing number of reality shows have made it possible for all those lucky ones to triumph. To illustrate this further, David Archuleta who was once a nobody has now taken up a large space in hearts of many. Hence, it is evident that individuals born with talents have also a high chance to be successful.\n",
      "To wrap it all up, it is indeed true that university education is pivotal in a person's life in order for one to prosper. However, it would be wrong to say that one's success completely depends on the education he or she receives at the institutions. Natural talent and hard work also contribute to their progress.\n",

       "\"Prepared Food\\n\\nNowadays, more and more people begin to select prepared food as their daily meals, since it can effectively save time which is considered as money in our modern society. However it is obvious that prepared food can bring about some negative influence result from utilizing the artificial ingredients, ignoring the nutrition of food and modifying people's eating habits. In this essay, I would like to explain why this is not a good thing based on the three reasons above.\\nFirst of all, to make their food easier to prepare and taste delicious, almost every producer adds a wide range of artificial ingredients in to the food that is now purchased by most people. Some ingredients being added have caused dire consequences. For instance, there are usually some articles in newspapers and magazines which report the relationship between certain chemical components in some food and diseases. Thus, easy-to-cook foods sometimes could be dangerous for human's health.\\nNot cooking fresh food will also lead to the lack of nutrition. It is true that cooking prepared food needs much less time in comparison with the fresh food. Whereas some research has apparently demonstrated that prepared food is unable to support enough nutrients we need, especially for children who are growing up.\\nIn addition, cooking is one of arts humans create. The more prepared food we eat the more cooking skills we lose. At the increasing living pace, the majority of people tend to choose microwave as their unique cooker that help them prepare a dish in five minutes. But rare people have been aware that this has contributed to a modification of cooking habits, which may cause the loss of our custom and culture about cooking.\\nIn conclusion, although the invention of prepared foods definitely satisfies the demand of some people who are busy in their work, it is not a good thing. Cooking is not a waste of time, contrarily, it is crucial for our health and culture.\\n\""

This is an interesting question because it affects a great amount of students worldwide. Nonetheless there are various different policies regarding this topic. An important aspect might be whether one desires to optimize the learned knowledge or the amount of valuable experiences for the students. However, to my mind students should be free not to attend classes because it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills.\\nFirstly, a liberal policy is very feasible. Checking for attendance requires a lot of bureaucracy. Especially for larger classes it is impossible to check for everybody to attend. So an optional attendance saves time and money.\\nSecondly, some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook. This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic. By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching. Thus they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently.\\nIn addition, being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life. Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning. With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency. Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas.\\nFinally, psychology knows two types of motivation. There is intrinsic motivation which comes from your own mindset. And there is extrinsic motivation which comes from the praise and laud of other people. Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being. However, in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims. By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves. These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time.\\nTo conclude, it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students. I hold this belief due to the improvement of students\\' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards.\\n## Output:\\n{\\n  \"MajorClaims\": {\\n    \"MC1\": \"students should be free not to attend classes\",\\n    \"MC2\": \"it is clear that going to classes should be optional for students\"\\n  },\\n  \"Claims\": {\\n    \"C1\": \"it improves the quality of student life as well as their learning motivation and teaches important life skills\",\\n    \"C2\": \"I hold this belief due to the improvement of students\\' current experience as well as the valuable skills and knowledge they obtain for their whole life afterwards\",\\n    \"C3\": \"some students might learn better at home on their own, for instance, by reading the textbook\",\\n    \"C4\": \"being free to stay away from classes improves flexibility and therefore quality of student life\",\\n    \"C5\": \"By giving students the freedom to choose about class attendance they might rather be thinking about why they decided to study and learn to motivate themselves\"\\n  },\\n  \"Premises\": {\\n    \"P1\": \"This problem occurs especially if the lecturer is lethargic\",\\n    \"P2\": \"By letting students choose not to attend class you give them the opportunity to escape bad teaching\",\\n    \"P3\": \"they are able to save precious study time and dive into the course syllabus independently\",\\n    \"P4\": \"Sometimes the wild party on Thursday night is too good to end already at midnight only because of a lecture on Friday in the morning\",\\n    \"P5\": \"With a liberal policy students are able to postpone the learning to the afternoon which gives a feeling of freedom and improves time efficiency\",\\n    \"P6\": \"Research has shown that the more satisfied the students are with those life aspects, the better they perform in academic areas\",\\n    \"P7\": \"Intrinsic motivation is known to be much more desirable because it leads to better learning and well-being\",\\n    \"P8\": \"These are crucial skills for the duration of their study and their whole life time\",\\n    \"P9\": \"in order to gain intrinsic motivation students need to become aware of their strengths and aims\"\\n  },\\n  \"ArgumentativeRelations\": [\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"C1\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"C2\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"C3\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P2\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"P3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P3\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P1\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"C4\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P4\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C4\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P5\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C4\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P6\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C4\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"C5\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P9\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C5\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P7\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C5\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"Claim\": \"P8\",\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\n      \"Target\": \"C5\"\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='Text: [\\'data/original/brat-project-final/essay176.txt\\'\\n \\'data/transformed/essay176.json\\' \\'essay176.txt\\' \\'essay176.json\\'\\n \\'Why people visit museums?\\\\n\\\\nAs a lover of travel, a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour, which can be explained by the following reasons.\\\\nPrimary, it is easy to know the history of the new place. Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York. Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears. Thus, museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place.\\\\nSecondary, visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon. Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us! In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts. To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown.\\\\nMoreover, a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit. Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel. As a result, visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision. Most important of all, a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time.\\\\nFor the above reasons, if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums. During our trip, it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place.\\'\\n \\'{\\\\n  \"MajorClaims\": {\\\\n    \"MC1\": \"a quintessence of any visit to an excellent museum of a new place would be the best part of a tour\",\\\\n    \"MC2\": \"if we have a chance to visit top museums in the world, we must stop by these museums\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"Claims\": {\\\\n    \"C1\": \"museums can help us know the history and the customs of a new place\",\\\\n    \"C2\": \"visiting a well-known museum also can broaden our horizon\",\\\\n    \"C3\": \"a local museum could be a top choice and destination for tourist to visit\",\\\\n    \"C4\": \"it is worthwhile for us to visit a museum of a new place\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"Premises\": {\\\\n    \"P1\": \"it is easy to know the history of the new place\",\\\\n    \"P2\": \"Last year, I went to Ellis Island and the immigration museum, where is a symbol of American immigration and the immigrant experience in the New York\",\\\\n    \"P3\": \"Through the exhibit, I found that the Statue of Liberty symbolized freedom, and Ellis Island may be the place, where the immigration took their dreams and fears\",\\\\n    \"P4\": \"Those outstanding and diverse range of objects,with classic and magnificent art, is guaranteed to inspire us\",\\\\n    \"P5\": \"In my city, National Palace Museum is celebrated for collection of ancient Chinese artifacts\",\\\\n    \"P6\": \"To my astonishment, Jadeite cabbage is the most famous artistic work, which is made of jade, is vividly shown\",\\\\n    \"P7\": \"Someone take a trip without making any plans, so they may waste their time on shopping or staying at their hotel\",\\\\n    \"P8\": \"visiting a museum saves their precious time for making a decision\",\\\\n    \"P9\": \"a local museum represent its own typical culture so that visitors may easily acquaint with the new place in a short time\"\\\\n  },\\\\n  \"ArgumentativeRelations\": [\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"C1\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P3\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P2\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P1\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C1\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"C2\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P4\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P5\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P6\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C2\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"C3\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P7\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"P8\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P9\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"P8\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"supports\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"C3\"\\\\n    },\\\\n    {\\\\n      \"Claim\": \"C4\",\\\\n      \"Relation\": \"For\",\\\\n      \"Target\": \"MC\"\\\\n    }\\\\n  ]\\\\n}\\']', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n"
