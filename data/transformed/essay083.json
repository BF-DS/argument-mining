        "MC1": "I find myself aligned with opponents of the usages of nuclear power",
        "MC2": "nuclear power may appear silver bullet for energy crisis but its disadvantages far outweigh the advantages"
    },
    "Claims": {
        "C1": "pursuit of nuclear technology one way or the other leads towards atomic weapons",
        "C2": "even civil usages of atomic power pose a dire threat of radio activity",
        "C3": "Safely getting rid of nuclear waste is a daunting task and there has not been any permanent solution of it"
    },
    "Premises": {
        "P1": "Last century has witnessed the horrors of such weapons",
        "P2": "If each country pursues the fusion and fission process some of them may try to mold it for military usage",
        "P3": "recently there has been an incident in which an atomic power house leaked tons of radio active material into air when an earthquake hit the surrounding area",
        "P4": "This unfortunate event proves that no matter how much careful we are such accidents are inevitable",
        "P5": "while generating energy from any source be it hydro power or oil there always is some wastage and so is the case with nuclear power",
        "P6": "This waste is many times more lethal to our environment than any of the other hazardous material"
