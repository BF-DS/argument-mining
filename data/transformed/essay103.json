    "MajorClaims": {
        "MC1": "I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions"
    },
    "Claims": {
        "C1": "past behaviour determines the future actions",
        "C2": "in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only",
        "C3": "I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict"
    },
    "Premises": {
        "P1": "complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality",
        "P2": "past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder",
        "P3": "a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record",
        "P4": "Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions"
