    "MC1": "it would be a better implication by the government to promote other sources of energy"
  },
  "Claims": {
    "C1": "This can make use of the available natural resources which in turn would reduce the global warming",
    "C2": "it would be a good implication by the government to generate electricity from other available sources",
    "C3": "the sources most widely used currently to generate power releases extensive amount of gases into the atmosphere which increases global warming"
  },
  "Premises": {
    "P1": "the major source of energy today is water",
    "P2": "there is a lot of water shortage to generate electricity many countries still rely only on this source",
    "P3": "To generate such a vast energy the fundamental resources are falling short",
    "P4": "during summer there will be a lot of power cut in the developing countries such as India",
    "P5": "If the government encourage the use of nuclear, solar or wind energy there might not be any problem in distributing the required amount electricity",
    "P6": "the use of a solar cooker instead of an electric cooker would certainly reduce the global warming",
    "P7": "the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to the hydro-kinetic energy causes less atmospheric pollution"
