  "MajorClaims": {
    "MC1": "governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable",
    "MC2": "violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency"
  },
  "Claims": {
    "C1": "it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies",
    "C2": "it would certainly be a violation of adults\u2019 civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences"
  },
  "Premises": {
    "P1": "reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate",
    "P2": "governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children\u2019s television programs",
    "P3": "As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong",
    "P4": "by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes",
    "P5": "adults watch horror video or war movies for relaxing themselves after a busy day",
    "P6": "For whom, such media sources are mere materials of relaxation and entertainment",
    "P7": "Considering that these mature minds are capable of being responsible for their own behaviors, they certainly have the right to watch TV shows or movies that are appealing to them"
