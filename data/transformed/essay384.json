        "MC1": "governments should definitely reduce violent components to the minimum in kidvids, while such contents remain in the TV shows that for mature minds to watch would be entirely reasonable",
        "MC2": "violent contents must be excluded from all kidvids in order to reduce the proportion of juvenile delinquency"

    "Claims": {
        "C1": "it would be rather necessary for governments to establish an intensive law that prevents teenagers from watching these violent and brutal TV Shows and movies",
        "C2": "it would certainly be a violation of adults\u2019 civil liberties, if governments implement such a restricted regulation on these TV shows or movies that only for mature audiences"

    "Premises": {
        "P1": "reducing the proportion of violent content in TV shows could, to some degree, decrease the overall crime rate",
        "P2": "governments must first prohibit any types of violent content in all children\u2019s television programs",
        "P3": "As a result of mental immaturity, most youngsters are incapable of distinguishing right from wrong",
        "P4": "by watching these violent TV programs and videos, juveniles will become very aggressive and offensive and have a great tendency to commit crimes",
