    "MC1": "these taxes are absolutely essential",
    "MC2": "taxes paying for state schools are necessary to be compulsory for all members of society no matter where their children enroll in"

  "Claims": {
    "C1": "by paying taxes for public school, affluent people effectively contribute to narrowing down the gap between rich and poor",
    "C2": "the tax reduction for parents of children studying in private schools would lead to a waste of public capital",
    "C3": "such tax payments are unfair for them"
  },
  "Premises": {
    "P1": "many poor families are not able to afford tuition fees for their kids to attend a course",
    "P2": "With the the tax amount for which they pay, the rich may help a vast number of students from families with poverty background to continue their studies, and earn a better quality of life",
    "P3": "this reduction would cause a difficulty to the tax calculation",
    "P4": "the government would have to recruit a greater workforce in order to handle this sophisticated issue",
    "P5": "the government would also pay the salary for the excessive officials, and this would result in insufficient investments in other crucial public sectors such as education or health care",
    "P6": "it is irrational to require them to pay for the taxes they do not use",
    "P7": "we also pay for the public services that we even do not experience a chance to employ like police or fire brigade",
