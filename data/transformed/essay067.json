    "MajorClaims": {
        "MC1": "freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create",
        "MC2": "they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas"
    },
    "Claims": {
        "C1": "this world needs them to make itself colourful",
        "C2": "One of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society",
        "C3": "restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply"
    },
    "Premises": {
        "P1": "the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work",
        "P2": "art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning",
        "P3": "If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value",
        "P4": "the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified",
        "P5": "some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc",
        "P6": "adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents",
        "P7": "in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide \u2013 these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art"
