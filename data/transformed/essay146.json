    "MajorClaims": {
        "MC1": "students should study a broad range of subjects from literature to mathematics",
        "MC2": "students should find interesting subjects and acquire general knowledge to prepare higher education at tertiary education"
    },
    "Claims": {
        "C1": "tertiary education should make students prepare for specialization at university",
        "C2": "it should be to some extent paternalistic to prevent students from avoiding hurdles",
        "C3": "students have to find one or more fields of study in which they are really interested",
        "C4": "high school students should learn broadly and prepare future learning at university",
        "C5": "schools should be responsible for their future and protect them"
    },
    "Premises": {
        "P1": "They should not decide their future major without trying a broad range of subjects, otherwise they might miss valuable encounter with the subject",
        "P2": "a would-be mathematician student may be strongly intrigued by philosophy and make a success in the field",
        "P3": "students should obtain knowledge from a variety of academic fields",
        "P4": "General education plays a significant role in specialized education",
        "P5": "Science today, for example, is said to be more and more specialized, but in order to solve a problem scientists have to combine knowledge from chemistry to physics",
        "P6": "textbooks used in higher education are labelled particular subjects, in fact they require basic understanding of other subjects",
        "P7": "you sometimes need knowledge about physics to read a text on chemistry",
        "P8": "students have tendency to shun difficulties",
        "P9": "They might avoid tough courses, but instead attend mainly Mickey Mouse courses and enjoy themselves too much",
        "P10": "This might result in limited choices in the future"
